# 1. Accuracy Scores:
- Accuracy of Training Set: 1.0 (100%)
- Accuracy of Testing Set: 1.0 (100%)
This means the model perfectly classified all the data points in both the training and testing sets, which is a strong indication of either:

A highly effective model, or
Potential overfitting, especially if the simulated dataset is too simplistic.
